# FNS-to-PGN-for-chess-puzzles-
A CPP code to convert puzzle files (FNS format files) in Lucas Chess to PGN format.


# USE
1- Compile the code or run fnstopgn.exe directly.

2- Select the language in which you want the things you need to do to be written (1 = Turkish, 2 = English)

3- Make sure that the FNS file to be converted and the path where the EXE file is located are the same.

4- Type the name of the FNS file to be converted, with its extension (for example matein.fns)

5- Watch the conversion and use the generated PGN file.


# ADDITIONAL INFO

The "Lichess puzzles option" deals with converting the resulting NFS files to PGN after you have already placed them in Lucas Chess software as puzzles or games, which can then be used as puzzles.

For example, you downloaded the lichess puzzle database and processed them as puzzles in Lucas Chess. It then deals with converting the resulting NFS puzzle file to PGN.

The "other puzzles" option is for converting puzzle files that already exist in Lucas Chess to PGN.
For example, "Training > Tactics > Training positions > Checkmates in GM games > Mate in 2" can be used to convert this NFS type puzzle to PGN.

To access the NFS files of these puzzles, you can navigate to the path ```\AppData\Local\Programs\LucasChessR\Resources\Trainings\```.
